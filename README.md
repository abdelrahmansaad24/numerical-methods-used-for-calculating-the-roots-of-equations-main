# numerical-methods-used-for-calculating-the-roots-of-equations
## Objective
The aim of this project is to compare and analyze the behavior of the different 
numerical methods used for calculating the roots of equations:
  1. Bisection
  2. False-Position
  3. Fixed point
  4. Newton-Raphson
  5. Secant Method.
## Description
Implement the root finder program which takes as an input the 
equation, the technique to use and its required parameters (e.g. interval for the 
bisection method).
